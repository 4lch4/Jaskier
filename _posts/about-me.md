## Overview

I... Write code.

In reality, I'm a lazy guy who likes to watch movies/tv shows/YouTube, play video games, that kind of stuff. I also happen to know how to write code so when I find myself getting annoyed at a task, I create something to make it less annoying.

I'm not too sure how to structure this page, so I'm gonna start with a resume style and see how that looks. If you're seeing this and it's in a resume style, then I obviously stuck with that ðŸ˜…

### Jobs

I've worked a good range of jobs from Sandwich Artist to NOC Engineer. For my own sake, I'm going to list all of the jobs I've ever had from most recent to oldest.

#### NOC Engineer â€” (2019 - Present)

My official title is Operations Engineer III, but I'm referred to as a NOC Engineer as I work in the NOC at [J. B. Hunt][2].

#### Freelance Software Developer (2017 - 2019)

I was doing various freelance projects for clients that I would find through [Upwork][3]. I did this for a couple years as my company [HassleFree Solutions, LLC.][4] and mostly worked with the same few clients that had on-going projects.

The vast majority of this work revolved around customizing SquaredUp websites. Wanting a button to look a certain way and not being able to do it because of x or y.

#### Jr. Software Test Engineer â€” (08/2015 - 05/2017)

This was my first professional job out of college. I was tasked with testing the suite of programs that [SAPIEN Technologies][5] sold. The two primary products being PowerShell Studio and PrimalScript, both IDEs for scripting, with PowerShell Studio focusing entirely on PowerShell, whereas PrimalScript was for all forms of scripting.

Another part of this job was converting their existing iOS app iPowerShell to Android so they could have a version for both iPhone and Android. It was my first experience creating an Android app but we wound up publishing it for quite some time.

#### Merchandiser â€” (09/2014 - 03/2015)

I was assigned a few stores in a roughly 30 mile radius that I was responsible for stocking various products. For example, the card stands at Dollar General and Family Dollar were a big job. We'd go and replace the cards for each season and put out the newest ones.

#### Associate â€” (05/2014 - 08/2014)

I worked in the stock room of our local Walmart Supercenter. Each day started by unloading the trucks with the shipment for the day and then distributing all of the packages to the correct departments on pallets. We'd usually wrap the day up by zoning some aisles to make sure they were presentable for the following day.
